# CSS Frameworks and Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors and frameworks are two important tools in a web developer's toolbox that can help streamline the process of building websites. CSS preprocessors allow developers to use new functionality that is typically borrowed from another programming language, while frameworks provide pre-written app skeletons and collections of built-in functionality that allow developers to avoid having to write all of the code from scratch.

## CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend standard CSS features with new functionality borrowed from other programming languages. Variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations are common examples. While preprocessors don't introduce anything that can't be accomplished with plain CSS, they offer a more efficient way of doing things.

The two most common preprocessors are:

* [SASS / SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)

### An outline of common features

Let's delve into some of the most prevalent CSS preprocessor features and see how they stack up against CSS4, the latest iteration of CSS.

#### Variables

Variables facilitate the use of named values in different sections of the code. For instance, if you've utilized 'red' in various properties and later opt for 'blue', with a variable, you can alter the value in a singular location, as opposed to tracking down each instance individually.

CSS:

```css
:root {
  --important-color: red;
}

body {
  color: var(--important-color);
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
$important-color: red;

body {
  color: $important-color;
}
```

LESS:

```less
@important-color: red;

body {
  color: @important-color;
}
```

#### Inheritance

Inheritance copies all definitions from one selector to another.

CSS (Using @apply):

```css
.parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  @apply .parent;
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
%parent {
  color: red;
}

child {
  @extend %parent;
}
```

LESS:

```less
.parent {
  color: red;
}

child {
  .parent();
}
```

#### Nesting

Nesting provides a more structured and readable way to write styles for nested elements. While CSS lacks a direct equivalent, the same effect can be achieved using multiple nested selectors.

SASS / LESS:

```css
.parent {
  .child {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

#### Mathematical operations

Mathematical operations enable dynamic value assignment based on another value, computed in real-time.

CSS:

```css
body {
  font-size: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

SCSS / LESS:

```scss
body {
  font-size: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

#### Functions

Functions are named sets of instructions that take arguments and return a computed value. They provide a way to perform complex calculations or transformations on CSS properties.

CSS:

Available functions include:

* `rgb()`
* `min()`
* `max()`

```css
body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  background-color: min(rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(0, 0, 0));
  background-color: max(rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(0, 0, 0));
}
```

SCSS / LESS: 

Available functions include:

* `lighten()`
* `darken()`
* `saturate()`

```scss
body {
  background-color: lighten(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
  background-color: darken(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
  background-color: saturate(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
}
```

#### Mixins

Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple CSS rules. They allow for writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, avoiding repetition.

CSS (Using @apply, somewhat limited):

```css
@custom-media --small-viewport (max-width: 30em);

@media (--small-viewport) {
  /* Rules here */
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
@mixin small-viewport {
  @media (max-width: 30em) {
    @content;
  }
}

@include small-viewport {
  /* Rules here */
}
```

LESS:

```less
.small-viewport(@rules) {
  @media (max-width: 30em) {
    @rules();
  }
}

.small-viewport({
  /* Rules here */
});
```

#### Conditionals and Loops

Conditionals and loops are not available in standard CSS. They allow for more dynamic and programmable stylesheets in preprocessors.

SCSS (Using conditionals and loops):

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
  .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; }
}

@if $theme == 'dark' {
  body { background: black; }
} @else {
  body { background: white; }
}
```

LESS (Similar capabilities):

```less
.loop(@counter) when (@counter > 0) {
  .item-@{counter} { width: 100px * @counter; }
  .loop(@counter - 1);
}
.loop(3);

@theme: dark;
.body(@theme) when (@theme = dark) {
  background: black;
},
.body(@theme) when (@theme = light) {
  background: white;
}
.body(@theme);
```

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks are essential tools in modern web development. They offer pre-written CSS code, helping developers to quickly build attractive and responsive websites without starting from scratch.

### What are CSS Frameworks?

A CSS framework is a library meant to simplify and standardize the process of styling web pages. It typically includes:

- **Pre-defined Stylesheets**: These stylesheets contain basic styles for common HTML elements.
- **Grid System**: Most frameworks include a grid system for creating layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Frameworks come with built-in media queries for different device sizes, ensuring that your website looks good on any device.
- **Component Library**: Many frameworks provide pre-styled components like buttons, forms, modals, etc.

### Benefits of Using CSS Frameworks

1. **Speed of Development**: Dramatically reduces the time needed to get a project off the ground.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform look and feel across your website.
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Frameworks handle most of the quirks between different browsers.
4. **Community and Support**: Popular frameworks have large communities, offering support and additional resources.

### Why the Variety of Frameworks?

Different frameworks cater to different needs:

- **Design Aesthetic**: Each framework has its unique style. Some developers prefer the minimalism of Tailwind, while others like the opinionated design of Bootstrap.
- **Flexibility vs. Structure**: Frameworks like Tailwind offer more flexibility but less built-in UI components, while others like Bootstrap provide more UI components but less customization flexibility.
- **Project Requirements**: Some projects may require specific features provided by a certain framework.

### Popular CSS Frameworks

1. **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**: Known for its comprehensive component library and robust grid system.
2. **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first framework that allows for more design customization.
3. **[Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/)**: A lightweight framework, ideal for quick, simple projects.
4. **[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)**: Offers human-friendly HTML and integrates well with React.
5. **[Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/)**: Focused on professional-grade responsiveness and accessibility.

## Common Elements of All Frameworks

When building a web project, it's important to consider certain foundational elements that are commonly addressed by popular frameworks. If you decide to forego a framework, you should have a strategy for these key aspects.

### Viewport

The viewport meta tag ensures that your site is properly scaled on different devices, especially on mobile where users should not have to zoom to view content. Include this in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

### Resets

Different browsers have their own default styling, which can lead to inconsistencies in how your site is rendered. To address this, there are two common strategies:

    CSS Reset: This approach strips away all built-in browser styling, giving you a clean slate. You can use Eric Meyer's Reset CSS for this purpose. Include it in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css">
```

Normalize.css: Rather than stripping styles, Normalize.css makes built-in browser styling consistent across different browsers. Include it in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/7.0.0/normalize.css">
```

### Box-Sizing

To ensure consistent rendering of elements' sizes, it's common to reset the box-sizing property. This makes working with padding and borders more intuitive:

```css
html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*:before,
*:after {
    box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Layout

Creating an effective layout is a critical aspect of web design. The layout should be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

#### Column-Based Layout
A common method is to divide content into columns, typically two or three. These columns can be flexible, adjusting their size based on the screen width, and can stack vertically on smaller screens.

```css
.column {
	float: left;
	width: 33.33%;
}

.row:after {
	content: "";
	display: table;
	clear: both;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
	.column {
		width: 100%;
	}
}
```

#### Content Width and Readability

While background styles may extend across the full viewport, it's often advisable to limit the width of the main content to enhance readability and focus.

```css
.container {
	margin: 0 auto;
	padding: 0 8px;
	max-width: 800px;
}
```

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are critical in responsive design, allowing layouts to adapt at certain screen widths. They are defined using media queries.

```css
/* Base styles (applied to all screen sizes) */
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    color: #333;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

.container {
    width: 90%;
    margin: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}

/* Styles for small devices (mobile phones) */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .container {
        width: 100%;
    }
    .column {
        width: 100%;
        padding: 0;
    }
}

/* Styles for medium-sized devices (tablets) */
@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
    .column {
        width: 50%;
    }
}

/* Styles for large devices (desktops) */
@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
    .container {
        width: 80%;
    }
    .column {
        width: 33.33%;
    }
}
```

#### Mobile-First Approach

The mobile-first technique starts by styling for smaller screens, then scaling up for larger devices. This approach ensures that your design is fundamentally responsive.

```css
/* Styles for mobile devices */

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
	/* Styles for laptops and PCs */
}
```

### Navigation

Effective navigation is key to a user-friendly website. Considerations for navigation design include:

- Orientation: Determine whether horizontal or vertical navigation is more appropriate for your site layout.
- Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens, a hamburger menu can save space while still offering easy access to the full menu.
- Submenu Display: Plan how to present submenu items, especially in responsive designs. This could include dropdown menus, side menus, or accordions.

#### Accessibility and UX

When designing navigation, prioritize both accessibility and user experience. Ensure that navigation is intuitive and accessible, with clear labels and logical structure.

#### Responsive Navigation

For responsive navigation, consider how the menu will adapt across different devices. For example, a horizontal menu on desktop might become a vertical sidebar or a dropdown menu on mobile.

### Typography

Typography is a fundamental element in web design, significantly impacting usability and aesthetics. CSS frameworks typically provide a set of typography rules for consistency and readability.

#### Font Styles and Sizes
Frameworks often define a set of font styles and sizes for various elements (like headings, paragraphs, and links), ensuring a harmonious and legible text hierarchy.

#### Responsive Typography
Consideration for different screen sizes is essential. Responsive typography adjusts font sizes and line heights to improve readability on various devices.

### Colors and Theming

The choice of colors and the ability to theme are crucial in defining the look and feel of a website.

#### Color Palette
Frameworks usually offer a predefined color palette that can be used throughout the project, ensuring consistency.

#### Custom Theming
Many frameworks allow for custom theming, enabling you to define your color schemes and apply them globally.

### Utility Classes

Utility classes are a set of helper classes to quickly style elements without writing custom CSS. They cover common use cases like margins, padding, text alignment, and visibility.

#### Consistency and Speed
Utility classes provide a consistent way to apply spacing, align text, and more, significantly speeding up the development process.

#### Balancing Use
While utility classes are convenient, it's important to balance their use to avoid overly verbose HTML and maintain readability.

### Forms and Inputs

Forms are an integral part of user interaction on websites. Frameworks provide styles for form elements to ensure consistency and usability.

#### Styling Controls
Consistent styling for text inputs, buttons, checkboxes, and other form controls is provided.

#### Validation and Accessibility
Frameworks often include styles for form validation states (like error messages) and focus on accessibility features.

### Grid Systems

Grid systems are the backbone of layout design, allowing for complex, responsive layouts.

#### Flexible Layouts
Grids provide a flexible way to create layouts that adapt to screen size and orientation.

#### Consistency Across Devices
By using a grid system, you ensure that your layout is consistent across different devices and screen sizes.


## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a widely-used, open-source front-end framework for designing responsive websites and web applications. Initially developed by Twitter engineers Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton in 2011, it leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to facilitate the creation of mobile-first and responsive designs.

### Core Features of Bootstrap

- **Responsive Grid System**: Bootstrap includes a flexible 12-column grid system that adjusts to the screen size, making it easy to create responsive layouts.
- **Pre-styled Components**: It offers a variety of pre-designed components like buttons, forms, modals, and navigation bars.
- **JavaScript Plugins**: Bootstrap comes with several jQuery-based JavaScript plugins adding functionality like carousels, tooltips, and popovers.
- **Customizable**: Bootstrap can be customized to fit the specific needs of your project.

### Including Bootstrap in Your Project

To use Bootstrap, add the following link to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

With this, Bootstrap's default styles will be applied to elements like `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<button>`, etc. For additional styling, use the appropriate Bootstrap class attributes in your HTML.

### Containers in Bootstrap

Containers are a fundamental concept in Bootstrap. They are used to encapsulate page content and provide consistent padding and centering.

I. **Fixed-Width Container (`container`)**: This class is used for a responsive fixed-width container. The width changes at different breakpoints (screen sizes), but it's always centered and padded from the viewport edges.

```html
<div class="container">
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

II. **Full-Width Container (`container-fluid`)**: This class creates a container that spans the entire width of the viewport. Useful for layouts that need to fill the whole width of the screen.

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
<h1>Full Width Content</h1>
<!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

### Grid System

Bootstrap’s grid system allows you to create complex layouts using a series of rows and columns.

How the Grid System Works:

- **Rows (`row`)**: A row is a horizontal grouping of columns. It ensures that columns within it are aligned properly and have equal heights.
- **Columns (`col-*`)**: Columns are the vertical divisions of the grid. Bootstrap's grid system allows for up to 12 columns across the page.

Example of a 3-Column Layout:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 1 Content</div>
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 2 Content</div>
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 3 Content</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

In this example, each col-md-4 class signifies that each column takes up 4 out of the 12 possible columns in the grid on medium-sized devices and larger.

### Responsive Design

Bootstrap's components and grid system are designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

#### Responsive Columns

- Column Classes: The col-* classes (like col-md-4) define the number of grid columns the element should span. The breakpoint in the class name (md in this case) indicates the screen size.

Example of Responsive Columns:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Content</div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Content</div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">Content</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

In this example:

- On medium (md) devices, each column takes up 4 grid spaces.
- On small (sm) devices, the first two columns take up 6 grid spaces each (half the screen), and the third column takes up all 12 spaces (full width).

### Navigation Components in Bootstrap

Bootstrap provides several components for creating navigation bars and menus, which are essential for user navigation in websites.

#### Navbar

The Navbar component is a responsive and versatile horizontal bar that can contain a brand, navigation links, forms, and other content.

Example of a Basic Navbar:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

#### Breadcrumb

Breadcrumb navigation is a simple navigation aid that helps users understand their current location within a website and navigate back to parent pages.

Example of a Breadcrumb:

```html

<nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
  <ol class="breadcrumb">
    <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Library</a></li>
    <li class="breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">Data</li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

### Buttons

- Bootstrap provides a variety of pre-styled buttons that can be used for actions, links, or form submissions.
- Primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, and dark are some of the pre-defined styles.

Example of Different Button Styles:

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
<!-- Additional button styles as needed -->
```

### Forms

- Forms are crucial for user interaction, and Bootstrap provides styled form elements that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
- Bootstrap includes styles for text inputs, select menus, checkboxes, radios, and more.

Example of a Simple Form:

```html
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label>
    <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp">
    <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleInputPassword1">Password</label>
    <input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleInputPassword1">
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Alerts

- Alerts are used to show important messages to the users, like warnings, errors, or confirmations.
- Bootstrap includes styles for success, danger, warning, info, and primary alerts.

Example of an Alert:

```html
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  This is a warning alert—check it out!
</div>
```

### Typography in Bootstrap

Bootstrap offers a wide range of typography classes to style your text content effectively.

- Bootstrap provides styles for headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
- Larger, more impactful headings called "Display Headings."
- The `.lead` class to make a paragraph stand out.
- The `<small>` tag or `.small` class for de-emphasized text.

Example of Typography Classes:

```html
<h1 class="display-1">Display Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Regular Heading 2</h2>
<p class="lead">This is a leading paragraph.</p>
<p>Regular paragraph text.</p>
<small class="text-muted">This is a small, muted text.</small>
```

### Customization of Bootstrap

Bootstrap’s customization ability lets you tailor the framework to fit your design needs.

Customizing with SASS/SCSS:

- Modify Bootstrap’s source SASS/SCSS files to change the look and feel of components.
- Customize variables like color schemes, fonts, and more.

Build Tools for Customization:

- Tools like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp can help streamline the customization process.
- These tools can compile your SASS/SCSS files, include only necessary Bootstrap components, and more.

Example of Customizing Bootstrap with SCSS:

```scss
// Customizing the primary color
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #ff6347 // Tomato color
);

@import "bootstrap";
```

In this SCSS example, the $theme-colors map is overridden to change the primary color used throughout Bootstrap components.

### Step-by-step guide to creating Bootstrap projects

Creating a basic "Hello World" project with Bootstrap involves the following steps. This guide assumes you are familiar with basic HTML and CSS:

I. **Set Up Your HTML File**

- Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.
- Open `index.html` in a text editor.

II. **Include Bootstrap**

- Add Bootstrap's CSS and JS to your HTML file. You can use Bootstrap's CDN (Content Delivery Network) for quick setup.
- Inside the `<head>` tag, include Bootstrap’s CSS:

```html
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ775iR6n9rC6jxo2E5h7X/0pZ72n/VAapMo" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

- Before the closing `</body>` tag, include Bootstrap’s JS and its dependencies:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

III. **Create a Basic Layout**

- Use Bootstrap’s grid system or components to create your page layout.
- For a simple "Hello World" message, you can use a Bootstrap container:

```html
<div class="container">
<h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

IV. **Customize with Bootstrap Classes**: Utilize Bootstrap's classes for typography, buttons, or other components to enhance your page.

V. **View Your Project**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to view your Bootstrap-styled "Hello World" project.
