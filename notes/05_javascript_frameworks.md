## JavaScript Frameworks

* Most Web Apps today are built using a JavaScript framework rather than written in Vanilla JavaScript.
* Almost everyone agrees that every frontend developer should be familiar with at least one JavaScript framework.
* Some take it to the extreme and start learning the frontend development with one of JavaScript frameworks. 
* I still believe that before diving into the world of JavaScript frameworks, you should first understand the fundamentals of frontend development. So if you haven't done that by now, I suggest you take a step back and learn the basics.

## What are frameworks?

A software framework is a pre-written app skeleton on which you may further develop. It is a collection of files and folders to which you may modify as well as add your files and folders. A framework addresses following development issues:

* We don't want to start projects from scratch every time. A framework offers boilerplate code. 
* We want a consistent method of spreading functions across files and directories. A framework provides a structure for your project.
* We want consistency in the way our UI elements are styled. A framework provides a consistent style guide.
* When writing functions, we need rules to follow. A framework offers us with numerous examples that we may strive to emulate. 

### Problems addressed by the frameworks

We already learned how to create a simple website using just three files: index.html, style.css and script.js. This setup works well for a simple website, but quickly becomes cumbersome when you want to add more functionality.

* Frameworks usually come with a set of files and folders that you can modify as needed. That boilerplate code allows you to setup a working project in a matter of minutes.
* Frameworks are designed to be easily maintainable. You can easily add new functionality to your project without having to rewrite the code.
* Most frameworks separate the logic and the presentation. It's easier to write the code that does a single thing well, instead of trying to do everything at once.
* There hundreds of articles, blog posts, YouTube videos and tutorials on the subject. You can find everything you need to know about frameworks, ask questions and get help from the community.
* Because most frameworks are open source, they are available to anyone who wants to learn how to use them. Many developers are familiar with them and can easily contribute to the project based on their experience.

### Disadvantages

As with everything in life, there are benefits and costs to using frameworks.

* When starting to learn a framework, you are presented with a black box. You have no idea what the framework is doing behind the scenes. Understanding the underlying workings of any framework takes time and effort.
* Frameworks are often quite complicated. It may take some time for you to feel completely comfortable with them.
* Frameworks frequently contain restrictions on how they may be used. In contrast to using a library, you do not have complete control over the structure of your project. Depending on how you look at it, this might be good or bad. 
* Unless your project is quite large, utilizing a framework provides little advantage. This includes some comercial products as well. Frameworks are not always the best answer.
* The JavaScript framework ecosystem is notorious for its volatility. There are several new frameworks and libraries being introduced to the ecosystem all the time. 

### What kinds of frameworks are there? 

There are, in reality, hundreds, if not thousands, different frameworks. Anyone, including you and me, may create their own framework. Fortunately, there are just a few that are widely popular, so it's not too bad. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript-based_web_frameworks
">Wikipedia</a> mentions over 20 frameworks and their comparisons, although the vast majority of those mentioned are either dead or outdated.

### How to learn a framework?

1. I recommend first learning the basics of Vanilla JavaScript and working on a few projects in it.
2. Then, you may try to take a crash course on the framework of your choice to obtain a rough sense of what it is and what it can be used for.
3. Then, immediately begin converting one of your previous projects to your preferred framework. 

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, often referred to as a framework due to its extensive ecosystem. Unlike a framework, which provides a structured approach to building applications, a library like React allows for more flexibility in implementation.

Pros:

- React is currently the most popular library for building user interfaces, which means that there is a high demand for developers skilled in React. This popularity also indicates a robust job market and numerous opportunities for React developers.
- React is backed by Meta (formerly Facebook), a major tech company, ensuring continuous development, updates, and long-term support. This backing provides confidence in React’s longevity and relevance in the industry.
- The core library of React is relatively small, which makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to learn. Developers can quickly get up to speed and start building applications without needing to understand a vast amount of codebase.
- There is a huge and active community around React. This extensive community provides a wealth of resources, including tutorials, documentation, forums, and third-party libraries. Developers can easily find solutions to common problems, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects.
- React’s component-based architecture allows for reusable and maintainable code. Developers can create modular components that can be reused across different parts of an application, reducing redundancy and improving code quality.
- React’s virtual DOM implementation ensures efficient updates and rendering of components, leading to improved performance, especially in dynamic applications.
- React has a rich ecosystem with numerous tools and libraries that enhance development productivity. Tools like Create React App, React DevTools, and various state management libraries (such as Redux) simplify and streamline the development process.

Cons:

- The small core library of React means that developers often need to incorporate many other plugins and libraries to achieve desired functionality. This can lead to increased complexity in managing dependencies, potential version conflicts, and a steeper learning curve to understand how different libraries work together.
- React and its ecosystem evolve rapidly, which can be challenging for developers to keep up with. Frequent updates and changes in best practices require continuous learning and adaptation.
- Setting up a React project can involve a significant amount of boilerplate code, especially when integrating additional libraries for state management, routing, and other functionalities.
- While the basics of React are easy to grasp, advanced concepts such as state management, context API, hooks, and server-side rendering can have a steep learning curve.
- Unlike some frameworks, React does not provide built-in solutions for common functionalities like routing, state management, or form handling. Developers need to rely on third-party libraries to fill these gaps, which can lead to inconsistency and varying quality of solutions.

### Core Elements

#### Component

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be thought of as custom, reusable HTML elements, and they encapsulate their own structure, style, and behavior.

Components in React are written using JSX, an extension to JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript. A component is a JavaScript function or class that returns a React element.

**Example of a Class Component:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

#### Props

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent components to child components. They are passed to the component as an argument.

**Example of Passing Props:**

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Paragraph text="This is a paragraph" />;
}

function Paragraph(props) {
  return <p>{props.text}</p>;
}
```

Props can also be passed between opening and closing tags of a component, accessible via `props.children`.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      </div>
    </Container>
  );
}

function Container(props) {
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
}
```

#### Mounting

Mounting is the process of rendering a React component to the DOM. It involves several lifecycle methods:

1. `constructor(props)` - Called before the component is mounted.
2. `render()` - Defines what the component UI looks like.
3. `componentDidMount()` - Called after the component is mounted.
4. `componentWillUnmount()` - Called before the component is unmounted and destroyed.
5. `componentDidCatch()` - Called when an error is thrown during rendering.

#### State

State is a way to manage dynamic data in a React component. It is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves.

**Example of Using State:**

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <p>{this.state.count}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### DOM Events

React supports all standard DOM events. Here is an example of handling a click event:

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <button onClick={() => alert('Hello World')}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Virtual DOM

React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. When a component’s state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one. Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM.

Steps:

1. The entire virtual DOM is updated.
2. The virtual DOM is compared to its previous state.
3. Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM.
4. The changes in the real DOM trigger the actual rendering on the screen.

This process can lead to performance improvements, especially for applications with frequent updates.

#### Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React can be done using JavaScript conditional statements like `if` or ternary operators.

**Example of Conditional Rendering:**

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ clicked: !this.state.clicked })}>
          {this.state.clicked ? 'Clicked' : 'Not clicked'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They work inside functional components and provide a way to reuse stateful logic.

#### useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components.

**Example of useState:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the component renders.

**Example of useEffect:**

```jsx
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component rendered');
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useRef

The `useRef` hook is used to access DOM elements directly.

**Example of useRef:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic.

**Example of useReducer:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer((state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        return state + 1;
      case 'decrement':
        return state - 1;
      default:
        throw new Error();
    }
  }, 0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>
        {count}
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>
        {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useContext

The `useContext` hook allows you to access the context object and subscribe to its changes.

**Example of useContext:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useMemo

The `useMemo` hook memoizes expensive computations to avoid re-executing them on every render.

**Example of useMemo:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const expensiveComputation = () => {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
      sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
  };

  const memoizedComputation = useMemo(expensiveComputation, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <p>{memoizedComputation}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Context API

The Context API is used for managing global state across a React application, especially for passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

**Creating a Context:**

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button style={{ background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#FFF' }}>Themed Button</button>;
}
```

#### Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

**Example of an Error Boundary:**

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.log(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <ComponentThatMayError />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

#### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component. They are used to reuse component logic.

**Example of a Higher-Order Component:**

```jsx
function withLoading(Component) {
  return function WithLoadingComponent({ isLoading, ...props }) {
    if (!isLoading) return <Component {...props} />;
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  };
}

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Data: {props.data}</div>;
}

const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);

function App() {
  return <MyComponentWithLoading isLoading={true} data="Some data" />;
}
```

#### Render Props

Render props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

**Example of Render Props:**

```jsx
class Mouse extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }

  handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        {this.props.render(this.state)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Mouse render={({ x, y }) => (
      <h1>The mouse position is ({x}, {y})</h1>
    )} />
  );
}
```

#### Portals

Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

**Example of Using Portals:**

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function Modal({ children }) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div className="modal">
      {children}
    </div>,
    document.getElementById('modal-root')
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <Modal>
        <h2>This is a modal</h2>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Fragments

Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**Example of Using Fragments:**

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### React.memo

`React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a component rendering, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

**Example of Using React.memo:**

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ count }) {
  console.log('Rendered MyComponent');
  return <div>{count}</div>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <MyComponent count={count} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Concurrent Mode

Concurrent Mode is a set of new features that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user’s device capabilities and network speed.

**Example of Enabling Concurrent Mode:**

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

#### Suspense

Suspense lets you wait for some code to load and declaratively specify a loading state.

**Example of Using Suspense:**

```jsx
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Refs and the useImperativeHandle Hook

Refs provide a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. The `useImperativeHandle` hook customizes the instance value that is exposed when using refs.

**Example of Using Refs and useImperativeHandle:**

```jsx
function CustomInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    },
  }));
  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}

CustomInput = forwardRef(CustomInput);

function App() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  return (
    <div>
      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.focus()}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Minimal Web App Using React

Let's take a look at a minimal web app that uses React. This guide will walk you through setting up the app from scratch, including installing necessary dependencies, setting up project structure, configuring Babel and Webpack, and writing the actual React code.

#### Prerequisites

To install any dependency, a package manager is needed. The most common one is NPM, which comes with Node.js.

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) by selecting the right installer for your platform. It includes the NPM package manager.
2. Verify that NPM was installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm --version
```

3. Create an empty NPM package by initializing a new project:

```sh
npm init
```

4. This will create a `package.json` file, which is a build configuration file that defines all dependencies and scripts for creating and testing the project.

#### Project Structure

At the end of this setup, your project will have the following structure:

```
|
|-- src
|   |-- App.js
|-- dist
|   |-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- webpack.config.js
|-- .babelrc
```

#### Transpiler

Transpilers are used to convert code between various programming languages or versions of the same programming language. If we use any modern JavaScript features or frameworks, we can use a transpiler to transform our code to an earlier version of JavaScript that is supported by all web browsers.

The transpiler used in this example is Babel. To install it, use the following commands:

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-loader
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
```

Create a `.babelrc` file to configure Babel. This file, in JSON format, describes how to transpile JavaScript code:

```json
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

#### Module Bundler

Webpack combines all NPM dependencies into a single `bundle.js` that can run in a browser. Use the following command to install it:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

A special file named `webpack.config.js` is needed to configure Webpack. The following is an example of this file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/App.js'),
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.jsx?$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
                loader: 'babel-loader',
                options: {
                    presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
                }
            }
        }]
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    devServer: {
        static: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
        port: 8000,
        hot: true
    },
};
```

#### Installing React

Two libraries are needed to use React: `react` and `react-dom`. Use the following command to install them:

```sh
npm install --save react react-dom
```

#### The Actual React Code

In the `src/App.js` file, include the following React script:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In addition to JavaScript, an HTML file is required to render the React code. Place the `index.html` file in the `dist` folder:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Minimal React App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Usage

1. To use the app, first, start the development server. Add the following script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --mode development"
}
```

2. Now, start the server by invoking the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the React app in action.

By following these steps, you will have set up a minimal React web application with Babel and Webpack.

## Vue

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of Vue as you need.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Vue is easy to learn and integrate with projects, even if they are using other JavaScript libraries.
- It can be used for small parts of a webpage or for large-scale single-page applications.
- Vue provides a reactive data-binding system.
- Similar to React, Vue uses a component-based structure.

Cons:

- Although growing, Vue's ecosystem is not as extensive as React's.
- The community and corporate backing are smaller compared to React.

### Core Elements

#### Component

Vue components are reusable instances with their own structure, style, and behavior. They are defined using a single file component (SFC) format with the `.vue` extension.

**Example of a Vue Component:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HelloWorld'
}
</script>

<style scoped>
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
```

#### Props

Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance.

**Example of Passing Props:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <Paragraph text="This is a paragraph" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Paragraph from './Paragraph.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    Paragraph
  }
}
</script>
```

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ text }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['text']
}
</script>
```

#### Directives

Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element. Vue has built-in directives such as `v-bind`, `v-model`, and `v-if`.

**Example of Using Directives:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <input v-model="message" />
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <p v-if="seen">Now you see me</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: '',
      seen: true
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Computed Properties

Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies and only re-evaluate when necessary. They are useful for complex data manipulations.

**Example of Computed Properties:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Original message: {{ message }}</p>
    <p>Reversed message: {{ reversedMessage }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello World'
    }
  },
  computed: {
    reversedMessage() {
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Methods

Methods are functions that are executed when events occur. They are useful for handling user inputs or other interactions.

**Example of Methods:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="greet">Greet</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    greet() {
      alert('Hello World');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Lifecycle Hooks

Vue components have a series of lifecycle hooks that allow you to add code at specific stages.

1. `beforeCreate`
2. `created`
3. `beforeMount`
4. `mounted`
5. `beforeUpdate`
6. `updated`
7. `beforeDestroy`
8. `destroyed`

**Example of Lifecycle Hooks:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello World'
    }
  },
  created() {
    console.log('Component created');
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component mounted');
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Watchers

Watchers are used to perform actions in response to data changes. They are particularly useful for asynchronous operations.

**Example of Watchers:**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <input v-model="question" />
    <p>{{ answer }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      question: '',
      answer: 'I cannot give you an answer until you ask a question!'
    }
  },
  watch: {
    question(newQuestion, oldQuestion) {
      this.answer = 'Waiting for you to stop typing...';
      this.getAnswer();
    }
  },
  methods: {
    getAnswer() {
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.answer = 'The answer to your question is 42!';
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Vue Router

Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js, making it easy to map components to routes and manage navigation.

**Example of Vue Router:**

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Router from 'vue-router';
import Home from './components/Home.vue';
import About from './components/About.vue';

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
    { path: '/about', component: About }
  ]
});

new Vue({
  router,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app');
```

### Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

**Example of Vuex:**

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  }
});

new Vue({
  store,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app');
```

### Minimal Web App Using Vue

Let's take a look at a minimal web app that uses Vue. This guide will walk you through setting up the app from scratch, including installing necessary dependencies, setting up project structure, configuring Babel and Webpack, and writing the actual Vue code.

#### Prerequisites

To install any dependency, a package manager is needed. The most common one is NPM, which comes with Node.js.

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) by selecting the right installer for your platform. It includes the NPM package manager.
2. Verify that NPM was installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm --version
```

3. Create an empty NPM package by initializing a new project:

```sh
npm init
```

4. This will create a `package.json` file, which is a build configuration file that defines all dependencies and scripts for creating and testing the project.

#### Project Structure

At the end of this setup, your project will have the following structure:

```
|
|-- src
|   |-- main.js
|   |-- App.vue
|-- dist
|   |-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- webpack.config.js
|-- .babelrc
```

#### Transpiler

Transpilers are used to convert code between various programming languages or versions of the same programming language. If we use any modern JavaScript features or frameworks, we can use a transpiler to transform our code to an earlier version of JavaScript that is supported by all web browsers.

The transpiler used in this example is Babel. To install it, use the following commands:

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
npm install --save-dev vue-loader vue-template-compiler
```

Create a `.babelrc` file to configure Babel. This file, in JSON format, describes how to transpile JavaScript code:

```json
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

#### Module Bundler

Webpack combines all NPM dependencies into a single `bundle.js` that can run in a browser. Use the following command to install it:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

A special file named `webpack.config.js` is needed to configure Webpack. The following is an example of this file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require('vue-loader');

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/main.js'),
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.vue$/,
                loader: 'vue-loader'
            },
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new VueLoaderPlugin()
    ],
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    devServer: {
        static: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
        port: 8000,
        hot: true
    },
};
```

#### Installing Vue

To use Vue, you need to install the `vue` library. Use the following command to install it:

```sh
npm install --save vue
```

#### The Actual Vue Code

In the `src/App.vue` file, include the following Vue template:

```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App'
}
</script>

<style scoped>
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
</style>
```

In the `src/main.js` file, include the following Vue script:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');
```

In addition to JavaScript, an HTML file is required to render the Vue code. Place the `index.html` file in the `dist` folder:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Minimal Vue App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Usage

1. To use the app, first, start the development server. Add the following script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --mode development"
}
```

2. Now, start the server by invoking the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the Vue app in action.

By following these steps, you will have set up a minimal Vue web application with Babel and Webpack.

## Angular

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is developed and maintained by Google, providing a robust and complete solution for web application development.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Angular provides a complete solution for front-end development, including a powerful CLI, routing, form handling, HTTP client, and more.
- Built with TypeScript, which offers static typing, better tooling, and helps catch errors early.
- Provides a powerful dependency injection mechanism.
- Promotes a modular approach to building applications.

Cons:

- Can be complex and have a steep learning curve compared to other frameworks.
- Angular applications can be verbose, requiring more boilerplate code.

### Core Elements

#### Component

Components are the fundamental building blocks of an Angular application. Each component consists of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class.

**Example of an Angular Component:**

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello World';
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<div>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

#### Modules

Modules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a set of related capabilities. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module.

**Example of an Angular Module:**

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

#### Directives

Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. There are three kinds of directives in Angular: components, structural directives, and attribute directives.

**Example of a Structural Directive (ngIf):**

```html
<div *ngIf="isVisible">
  This is visible.
</div>
```

**Example of an Attribute Directive:**

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(el: ElementRef, renderer: Renderer2) {
    renderer.setStyle(el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'yellow');
  }
}
```

#### Services and Dependency Injection

Services in Angular are used to share data or logic across multiple components. Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC, allowing a class to receive its dependencies from an external source.

**Example of a Service:**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  private data: string[] = ['Data 1', 'Data 2', 'Data 3'];

  getData() {
    return this.data;
  }
}
```

**Injecting a Service into a Component:**

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-data',
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</li>
    </ul>
  `
})
export class DataComponent implements OnInit {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

#### Routing

Angular Router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks. It is a separate module in Angular that needs to be imported.

**Example of Configuring Routes:**

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

**Using Router Outlet:**

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
  <a routerLink="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

#### Forms

Angular provides two approaches to handling user input through forms: reactive forms and template-driven forms.

**Example of Template-Driven Form:**

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form #form="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(form)">
  <input name="name" ngModel required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  onSubmit(form) {
    console.log(form.value);
  }
}
```

**Example of Reactive Form:**

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    ReactiveFormsModule
  ],
  // other properties
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = new FormGroup({
    name: new FormControl('')
  });

  onSubmit() {
    console.log(this.form.value);
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <input formControlName="name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a powerful tool that provides commands to scaffold, build, and manage Angular applications.

**Creating a New Angular Application:**

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```

**Serving the Application:**

```bash
cd my-angular-app
ng serve
```

**Generating Components, Services, etc.:**

```bash
ng generate component my-component
ng generate service my-service
```

### HttpClient

Angular's `HttpClient` service allows you to communicate with backend services over the HTTP protocol.

**Example of Using HttpClient:**

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  // other properties
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```typescript
// data.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  }
}
```

```typescript
// data.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-data',
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</li>
    </ul>
  `
})
export class DataComponent implements OnInit {
  data: any;

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.dataService.getData().subscribe(data => {
      this.data = data;
    });
  }
}
```

#### Angular Material

Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular developers. It follows Google's Material Design guidelines and provides a rich set of UI components.

**Example of Using Angular Material:**

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    MatButtonModule,
    MatInputModule
  ],
  // other properties
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<button mat-raised-button>Click me</button>
<input matInput placeholder="Enter text">
```

#### Custom Directives

Custom directives in Angular allow you to extend the functionality of HTML elements.

**Example of a Custom Directive:**

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) {}

  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'yellow');
  }

  @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'white');
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<p appHighlight>Hover over me!</p>
```

#### Pipes

Pipes are a way to transform data in templates. Angular provides several built-in pipes, and you can also create your own custom pipes.

**Example of a Custom Pipe:**

```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({name: 'exponentialStrength'})
export class ExponentialStrengthPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: number, exponent: string): number {
    let exp = parseFloat(exponent);
    return Math.pow(value, isNaN(exp) ? 1 : exp);
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<p>{{ 2 | exponentialStrength: '10' }}</p>
```

#### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique in Angular to load modules only when they are needed. This can significantly improve the performance of your application.

**Example of Lazy Loading:**

```typescript
// app-routing.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'feature',
    loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule)
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

```typescript
// feature-routing.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { FeatureComponent } from './feature.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: FeatureComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class FeatureRoutingModule { }
```

#### Testing

Angular provides robust tools for testing your applications, including unit tests and end-to-end tests.

**Example of Unit Testing with Jasmine and Karma:**

```typescript
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

describe('AppComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  it('should create the app', () => {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    const app = fixture.debugElement.componentInstance;
    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

**Example of End-to-End Testing with Protractor:**

```typescript
// e2e/src/app.e2e-spec.ts
import { browser, by, element } from 'protractor';

describe('workspace-project App', () => {
  it('should display welcome message', () => {
    browser.get('/');
    expect(element(by.css('app-root h1')).getText()).toEqual('Welcome to app!');
  });
});
```

#### Angular Animations

Angular provides a module for adding animations to your applications. The `@angular/animations` package offers a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define and run animations.

**Example of Angular Animations:**

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    BrowserAnimationsModule
  ],
  // other properties
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { trigger, state, style, transition, animate } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  animations: [
    trigger('openClose', [
      state('open', style({
        height: '200px',
        opacity: 1,
        backgroundColor: 'yellow'
      })),
      state('closed', style({
        height: '100px',
        opacity: 0.5,
        backgroundColor: 'green'
      })),
      transition('open => closed', [
        animate('0.5s')
      ]),
      transition('closed => open', [
        animate('0.5s')
      ]),
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppComponent {
  isOpen = true;

  toggle() {
    this.isOpen = !this.isOpen;
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<div [@openClose]="isOpen ? 'open' : 'closed'" class="box">
  <button (click)="toggle()">Toggle</button>
</div>
```

#### Angular Universal (Server-Side Rendering)

Angular Universal allows you to perform server-side rendering (SSR) of your Angular application. This can improve performance, SEO, and user experience.

**Setting Up Angular Universal:**

```bash
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
```

**Example of Angular Universal Application:**

After running the command above, Angular CLI will automatically set up an Angular Universal application. You can build and serve your application with SSR using the following commands:

```bash
npm run build:ssr
npm run serve:ssr
```

### Minimal Web App Using Angular

Let's take a look at a minimal web app that uses Angular. This guide will walk you through setting up the app from scratch, including installing necessary dependencies, setting up project structure, configuring TypeScript and Webpack, and writing the actual Angular code.

#### Prerequisites

To install any dependency, a package manager is needed. The most common one is NPM, which comes with Node.js.

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) by selecting the right installer for your platform. It includes the NPM package manager.
2. Verify that NPM was installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm --version
```

3. Create an empty NPM package by initializing a new project:

```sh
npm init
```

4. This will create a `package.json` file, which is a build configuration file that defines all dependencies and scripts for creating and testing the project.

#### Project Structure

At the end of this setup, your project will have the following structure:

```
|
|-- src
|   |-- app
|   |   |-- app.component.ts
|   |   |-- app.component.html
|   |   |-- app.component.css
|   |   |-- app.module.ts
|   |-- main.ts
|-- dist
|   |-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- webpack.config.js
```

#### Installing Angular

To use Angular, you need to install the Angular core library and its dependencies. Use the following command to install them:

```sh
npm install --save @angular/core @angular/common @angular/compiler @angular/platform-browser @angular/platform-browser-dynamic @angular/router rxjs zone.js
```

#### Setting Up TypeScript

Angular is built using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. To install TypeScript and configure it, use the following command:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript. This file, in JSON format, describes how to compile TypeScript code:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "es2015",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "lib": ["es2017", "dom"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@app/*": ["src/app/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

#### Module Bundler

Webpack combines all NPM dependencies into a single `bundle.js` that can run in a browser. Use the following command to install it:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
```

A special file named `webpack.config.js` is needed to configure Webpack. The following is an example of this file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/main.ts'),
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.js']
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/,
        use: 'html-loader'
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/index.html')
    })
  ],
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  devServer: {
    static: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    port: 8000,
    hot: true
  },
};
```

#### The Actual Angular Code

Create an Angular component in the `src/app/app.component.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello World';
}
```

Create the HTML template for the component in `src/app/app.component.html`:

```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```

Create the CSS for the component in `src/app/app.component.css`:

```css
h1 {
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}
```

Create the main module for the application in `src/app/app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Create the main entry file for the application in `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Create the HTML file for the application in `src/index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Minimal Angular App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Usage

1. To use the app, first, start the development server. Add the following script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --mode development"
}
```

2. Now, start the server by invoking the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the Angular app in action.

By following these steps, you will have set up a minimal Angular web application with TypeScript and Webpack.

## State Management Tools

State management is crucial in front-end development, especially for applications with complex data flows and interactions. Various state management tools and libraries can help manage application state efficiently. Here, we'll cover some of the most popular state management tools: Redux, Vuex, MobX, NgRx, and Recoil.

### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It is commonly used with React but can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library.

Pros:

- Predictable state updates with strict rules.
- Centralized state makes debugging and testing easier.
- Large ecosystem and community support.

Cons:

- Can be verbose and require boilerplate code.
- Learning curve for newcomers.

Core Concepts:

- **Store:** Holds the application state.
- **Actions:** Plain objects representing events that describe something that happened in the application.
- **Reducers:** Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.

**Example:**

```javascript
// actions.js
export const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
export const decrement = () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });

// reducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

export const counter = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { counter } from './reducer';

const store = createStore(counter);

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

const App = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Vuex

Vuex is the state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications, designed to manage the state of the entire application.

Pros:

- Deep integration with Vue.
- Provides a single source of truth for the application state.
- Strong developer tooling support.

Cons:

- Can be complex for simple applications.
- Requires boilerplate code.

Core Concepts:

- **State:** The single source of truth.
- **Getters:** Computed properties for the store's state.
- **Mutations:** Synchronous functions that directly change the state.
- **Actions:** Asynchronous functions that commit mutations.
- **Modules:** Allowing state, mutations, actions, and getters to be divided into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Example:**

```javascript
// store.js
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.count--;
    }
  },
  actions: {
    increment({ commit }) {
      commit('increment');
    },
    decrement({ commit }) {
      commit('decrement');
    }
  },
  getters: {
    count: state => state.count
  }
});
```

```html
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">+</button>
    <button @click="decrement">-</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { mapGetters, mapActions } from 'vuex';

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(['count'])
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapActions(['increment', 'decrement'])
  }
}
</script>
```

### MobX

MobX is a library for managing state that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).

Pros:

- Simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
- Automatic state management with observables.
- Good performance.

Cons:

- Less predictable compared to Redux.
- Smaller community compared to Redux.

Core Concepts:

- **Observable State:** The state that MobX tracks.
- **Computed Values:** Values derived from the state.
- **Reactions:** Side effects that react to state changes.
- **Actions:** Functions that modify the state.

**Example:**

```javascript
// store.js
import { makeAutoObservable } from 'mobx';

class CounterStore {
  count = 0;

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }

  decrement() {
    this.count--;
  }
}

export const counterStore = new CounterStore();
```

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';
import { counterStore } from './store';

const App = observer(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {counterStore.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.increment()}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.decrement()}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```

### NgRx

NgRx is a reactive state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux.

Pros:

- Predictable state management with unidirectional data flow.
- Integrates well with Angular's ecosystem.
- Strong community support.

Cons:

- Steeper learning curve and more boilerplate.
- Verbose compared to simpler state management solutions.

Core Concepts:

- **Store:** The single source of truth for the application state.
- **Actions:** Events that describe state changes.
- **Reducers:** Pure functions that handle state transitions.
- **Selectors:** Functions to select slices of the state.
- **Effects:** Side effects that handle complex logic.

**Example:**

```typescript
// actions.ts
import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';

export const increment = createAction('[Counter] Increment');
export const decrement = createAction('[Counter] Decrement');
```

```typescript
// reducer.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

export const initialState = 0;

const _counterReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(increment, state => state + 1),
  on(decrement, state => state - 1)
);

export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  return _counterReducer(state, action);
}
```

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { counterReducer } from './reducer';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    StoreModule.forRoot({ count: counterReducer })
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>Count: {{ count$ | async }}</p>
      <button (click)="increment()">+</button>
      <button (click)="decrement()">-</button>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  count$: Observable<number>;

  constructor(private store: Store<{ count: number }>) {
    this.count$ = store.select('count');
  }

  increment() {
    this.store.dispatch(increment());
  }

  decrement() {
    this.store.dispatch(decrement());
  }
}
```

### Recoil

Recoil is a state management library for React that provides a minimal and flexible API for managing state.

Pros:

- Minimal boilerplate and easy to use.
- Great performance with fine-grained reactivity.
- Easy integration with React's concurrent mode.

Cons:

- Relatively new with a smaller community.
- Limited to React.

Core Concepts:

- **Atoms:** Units of state.
- **Selectors:** Functions that compute derived state.
- **RecoilRoot:** The context provider for Recoil state.

**Example:**

```javascript
// atoms.js
import { atom } from 'recoil';

export const countState = atom({
  key: 'countState',
  default: 0
});
```

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { RecoilRoot, useRecoilState } from 'recoil';
import { countState } from './atoms';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(countState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <RecoilRoot>
    <Counter />
  </RecoilRoot>
);

export default App;
```
