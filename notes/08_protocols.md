## Protocols

It's important for frontend developers to really grasp how network protocols work. These protocols control how data moves across networks, making sure the frontend and backend communicate smoothly. It's not enough to just know the names and basic functions of these protocols â€” developers need to understand the details of how they operate to ensure that systems can communicate efficiently and securely.

### Foundational Concepts

#### Internet

The **Internet** is a vast, global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate using standardized protocols. It's not a single entity but a network of networks, consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks linked by various technologies.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Interconnectivity**: Allows diverse systems to communicate regardless of their underlying hardware or software.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate an ever-growing number of devices and users.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple pathways for data ensure reliability and fault tolerance.

**Underlying Technologies**:

- **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**: The fundamental communication protocols for the Internet.
- **Routers and Switches**: Hardware devices that direct data traffic efficiently.
- **Fiber Optic Cables and Satellites**: Physical mediums that transmit data over long distances.

```

#### Browsers

**Web browsers** are software applications that enable users to access, retrieve, and view information on the World Wide Web. They act as clients that send requests to web servers using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS and render the received content, which is typically in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript formats.

**Core Components**:

- **User Interface (UI)**: The visual elements, including the address bar, back/forward buttons, and bookmarks.
- **Browser Engine**: Bridges the UI and the rendering engine.
- **Rendering Engine**: Parses HTML/CSS and displays the content on the screen.
- **Networking**: Handles network calls, such as HTTP requests.
- **JavaScript Interpreter**: Executes JavaScript code for dynamic content.
- **Data Storage**: Manages cookies, local storage, and cache.

**Popular Browsers**:

- **Google Chrome**: Known for its speed and extensive developer tools.
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Emphasizes privacy and customization.
- **Microsoft Edge**: Built on Chromium, integrates with Windows ecosystem.
- **Safari**: Optimized for macOS and iOS devices.

**Developer Tools Features**:

- **Element Inspector**: Examine and modify the DOM and CSS.
- **Console**: Debug JavaScript code and view error messages.
- **Network Monitor**: Analyze HTTP requests and responses.
- **Performance Profiler**: Identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Security Panel**: Inspect security-related aspects like certificates and mixed content.

+--------------------------------------------------+
```

#### DNS (Domain Name System)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is often described as the Internet's phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like `openai.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`), enabling users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

**DNS Components**:

- **DNS Resolver**: Client-side component that initiates DNS queries.
- **Root Name Servers**: Authoritative servers for the root zone.
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**: Manage domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`.
- **Authoritative Name Servers**: Contain specific domain records.

**Types of DNS Records**:

- **A Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record**: Canonical name record, alias of one name to another.
- **MX Record**: Mail exchange server for email services.
- **TXT Record**: Text records, often used for verification and security.

**DNS Resolution Process**:

1. **User enters URL**: `www.example.com` in the browser.
2. **Browser cache**: Checks if the IP address is cached.
3. **Operating System cache**: If not in browser cache, checks OS cache.
4. **Recursive Resolver**: Queries a DNS resolver (usually via ISP).
5. **Root Server Query**: Resolver asks root server for TLD server.
6. **TLD Server Query**: Resolver asks TLD server for authoritative server.
7. **Authoritative Server Query**: Resolver obtains the IP address.
8. **Response to Browser**: IP address is returned to the browser.
9. **Connection Established**: Browser connects to the server using the IP address.

**DNS Query Flow Diagram**:

```
[Browser]
   |
[DNS Resolver]
   |
[Root Server] -> [TLD Server] -> [Authoritative Server]
   |
[IP Address Returned]
```

#### Domain Name

A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, corresponding to an IP address on the Internet. It provides an easy way for users to remember and navigate to websites without needing to memorize numeric IP addresses.

**Structure of a Domain Name**:

- **Subdomain**: Optional prefix (e.g., `www`, `mail`).
- **Second-Level Domain (SLD)**: The main part of the domain (e.g., `google`).
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**: The suffix (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).

**Example**:

```
[Subdomain].[Second-Level Domain].[Top-Level Domain]
    www            google                com
```

**Hierarchy and Management**:

- **ICANN**: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers oversees domain name allocation.
- **Registries**: Manage TLDs and maintain DNS records.
- **Registrars**: Organizations where individuals or entities can register domain names.
- **Registrant**: The person or organization that owns the domain name.

**Domain Name System Hierarchy**:

```
[.] (Root)
 |
[.com] (TLD)
 |
[example] (SLD)
 |
[www] (Subdomain)
```

### Protocols in Action

#### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundational protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, across the web. It operates on a **request-response model** where the client (usually a web browser) makes a request, and the server responds with the requested data.

Key characteristics of HTTP:

- **Request-Response Cycle**: The client sends a request, and the server returns a response.
- **Stateless Protocol**: Each HTTP request is independent, meaning the server does not retain any state between requests.
- **Transport Layer**: HTTP is typically implemented over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) in the transport layer.

**HTTP Request-Response Pair**:
- **Request**: Sent by the client and includes:
  - **Method**: Type of request (GET, POST, etc.)
  - **Headers**: Information about the request (e.g., content type, user agent)
  - **Body**: Data sent with some request types (POST, PUT)
- **Response**: Sent by the server and includes:
  - **Status Code**: Indicates the success or failure of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
  - **Headers**: Information about the response (e.g., content type, length)
  - **Body**: The requested data or message

**Basic HTTP Methods**:

| Method  | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `GET`   | Retrieve resources from the server |
| `POST`  | Submit data to the server, often to create or modify a resource |
| `PUT`   | Replace or add a resource at a specific URL |
| `PATCH` | Modify part of an existing resource |
| `DELETE`| Remove a resource |

#### HTTP Request-Response Cycle Diagram

```plaintext
[Client Browser] -- HTTP Request --> [Web Server]
                    <-- HTTP Response --
```

### Detailed Examples of HTTP Methods

#### GET Method

The `GET` method is used to request data from the server without modifying it. An example would be retrieving a webpage or making a query to a search engine.

**Sample HTTP GET Request**:

```plaintext
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
```

**Sample HTTP GET Response**:

```plaintext
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3057

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
...
```

**Using `curl` in the terminal** to make a `GET` request:

```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
```

**Response**:

```json
HTTP/2 200 
{
  "login": "octocat",
  "id": 583231,
  "name": "The Octocat",
  ...
}
```

#### POST Method

The `POST` method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource, such as submitting a form on a webpage.

**Using `curl` to send a POST request**:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"testpassword"}' "https://reqbin.com/echo/post/json"
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": "true",
  "data": {
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "testpassword"
  }
}
```

### HTTP APIs and Standards

Various standards have been established for APIs over time, allowing systems to communicate over HTTP.

Some of the key API standards include:

- **XML-RPC (1998)**: A protocol for remote procedure calls using XML to encode the calls.
- **SOAP (1999)**: A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.
- **REST (2000)**: An architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods to interact with resources.
- **JSON-RPC (2005)**: A remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON.
- **GraphQL (2015)**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to specify exactly the data they need.

#### REST (Representational State Transfer)

RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manipulate resources. Each resource is identified by a URL, and actions are performed using these methods.

**Example REST API**:

- `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`: A free fake API for testing and prototyping.
- `https://jsoning.com/api/`: An API for working with JSON data.
- `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`: A REST API providing country data.

**GET Request Example**:

```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3"
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 3,
  "title": "fugiat veniam minus",
  "completed": false
}
```

**POST Request Example**:

```bash
curl --data "title=New Todo&completed=false" https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "title": "New Todo",
  "completed": false,
  "id": 201
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the result of an HTTP request.

| Category        | Status Code Range  |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Informational   | 1xx                |
| Successful      | 2xx                |
| Redirection     | 3xx                |
| Client Error    | 4xx                |
| Server Error    | 5xx                |

**Common HTTP Status Codes**:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 200  | OK - The request was successful |
| 201  | Created - A resource was successfully created |
| 301  | Moved Permanently - The requested resource has a new permanent URI |
| 302  | Found - The resource is temporarily located at a different URI |
| 400  | Bad Request - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters |
| 401  | Unauthorized - Authentication is required |
| 403  | Forbidden - The request is understood, but the server is refusing to fulfill it |
| 404  | Not Found - The requested resource could not be found |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server |

### HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses **SSL/TLS** to encrypt communication between the client and server, providing three main benefits:

- **Confidentiality**: Data exchanged is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that data is not altered during transmission.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the server to ensure the client is communicating with the correct server.

#### HTTPS Connection Process

1. **Client Hello**: The client requests a secure connection, including supported encryption methods.
2. **Server Hello**: The server responds, providing its SSL certificate.
3. **Certificate Verification**: The client verifies the server's certificate to ensure it's authentic.
4. **Key Exchange**: Both parties agree on encryption keys to use for secure communication.
5. **Secure Communication**: Data is encrypted and exchanged securely.

#### FTP

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a TCP-based network.

**Key Features**:

- **Separate Control and Data Connections**: FTP uses two channels; one for commands (control) and one for transferring data.
- **Authentication**: Supports username and password authentication; anonymous FTP allows users to connect without credentials.
- **Active and Passive Modes**:
  - **Active Mode**: Server initiates data connection to the client.
  - **Passive Mode**: Client initiates both control and data connections.

**Security Considerations**:

- **Unencrypted Transmission**: Standard FTP does not encrypt data, including credentials.
- **FTPS and SFTP**: Secure alternatives that provide encryption (FTPS uses SSL/TLS; SFTP runs over SSH).

**FTP Workflow Diagram**:

```
[Client]
   |
[Control Connection (Commands)]
   |
[FTP Server]
   |
[Data Connection (File Transfer)]
```

**Common FTP Commands**:

- **LIST**: List files in the current directory.
- **RETR**: Retrieve (download) a file.
- **STOR**: Store (upload) a file.
- **DELE**: Delete a file.
- **MKD**: Make a new directory.

#### WebSockets

**WebSockets** enable full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time data exchange between client and server.

**Advantages**:

- **Bi-Directional Communication**: Both client and server can send messages independently.
- **Persistent Connection**: Reduces overhead of establishing multiple HTTP connections.
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for applications requiring immediate data updates.

**Use Cases**:

- **Chat Applications**: Real-time messaging between users.
- **Live Feeds**: Instant updates for news, sports scores, or social media.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Real-time document editing or shared workspaces.
- **IoT Data Streams**: Continuous data flow from sensors or devices.

**WebSocket Handshake Process**:

1. **Client Request**: Initiates an HTTP request with an `Upgrade` header.
2. **Server Response**: Confirms upgrade with `101 Switching Protocols`.
3. **Connection Established**: Protocol switches to WebSocket, and communication begins.

**Simplified WebSocket Diagram**:

```
[Client Browser] <---- Persistent Connection ----> [Server]
       |                                               |
    Send/Receive Messages in Real-Time
```

**Sample WebSocket Code (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection established.');
  socket.send('Hello Server!');
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};

socket.onclose = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');
};
```

#### TCP and UDP

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite, operating at the transport layer.

**TCP Features**:

- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
- **Reliable Delivery**: Ensures data packets are delivered in order and without errors.
- **Flow Control**: Manages data transmission rate between sender and receiver.
- **Error Checking**: Uses checksums for data integrity.

**UDP Features**:

- **Connectionless**: No need to establish a connection beforehand.
- **Unreliable Delivery**: No guarantee of packet delivery or order.
- **Low Overhead**: Faster due to minimal protocol mechanisms.
- **Suitable for Broadcasts**: Can send data to multiple recipients.

**Comparison Table**:

| Feature           | TCP                           | UDP                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Connection        | Connection-Oriented           | Connectionless            |
| Reliability       | Reliable (Acknowledgements)   | Unreliable                |
| Ordering          | Ordered Data Transmission     | No Ordering Guarantees    |
| Overhead          | Higher (due to error checking)| Lower                     |
| Use Cases         | Web Browsing, Email, File Transfer | Streaming, Gaming, VoIP |

**TCP Connection Process (Three-Way Handshake)**:

1. **SYN**: Client sends synchronization packet to server.
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server acknowledges with synchronization-acknowledgment packet.
3. **ACK**: Client sends acknowledgment to establish connection.

**TCP Diagram**:

```
[Client] -- SYN --> [Server]
[Client] <-- SYN-ACK -- [Server]
[Client] -- ACK --> [Server]
Connection Established
```

**UDP Communication Diagram**:

```
[Client] -- Data Packet --> [Server]
(No handshake; data sent immediately)
```

### Web Security Essentials

Web security is paramount in safeguarding websites and their users from malicious threats. It involves implementing measures to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

#### HTTPS

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data transferred between the browser and web server.

**Importance of HTTPS**:

- **Data Protection**: Encrypts communication to prevent interception.
- **Trust and Credibility**: Browsers display padlock icons for secure sites.
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines may rank HTTPS sites higher.
- **Compliance**: Necessary for handling sensitive information (e.g., payment data).

**SSL/TLS Protocols**:

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: Predecessor to TLS, now deprecated.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Current protocol providing secure communication.

**Certificate Authorities (CAs)**:

- Organizations that issue digital certificates verifying the ownership of encryption keys used in HTTPS.

**Visual Representation of HTTPS Connection**:

```
[Client Browser] <-- Encrypted Data --> [Web Server]
```

#### CORS

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a security feature that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin from accessing resources from a different origin.

**Same-Origin Policy**:

- By default, browsers enforce the same-origin policy, restricting cross-origin HTTP requests for security.

**CORS Headers**:

- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: Specifies authorized domains.
- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: Lists allowed HTTP methods.
- **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**: Indicates allowed request headers.
- **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: Specifies whether credentials can be included.

**CORS Request Types**:

- **Simple Requests**: GET, POST, HEAD with standard headers.
- **Preflight Requests**: OPTIONS method used to check permissions before actual request.

**CORS Workflow Diagram**:

```
[Browser] -- Preflight OPTIONS Request --> [Server]
                    |
         [Server sends CORS headers]
                    |
[Browser] -- Actual Request --> [Server]
```

#### Content Security Policy

**Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks by specifying trusted content sources.

**Implementing CSP**:

- **HTTP Headers**: Use `Content-Security-Policy` header to define policies.
- **Meta Tags**: Alternatively, specify policies within HTML using `<meta>` tags.

**Common Directives**:

- **default-src**: Fallback for unspecified directives.
- **script-src**: Allowed sources for JavaScript.
- **style-src**: Allowed sources for CSS.
- **img-src**: Allowed sources for images.
- **report-uri**: URL where the browser sends reports about policy violations.

**Example CSP Header**:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://images.example.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
```

**Benefits**:

- **Reduces Attack Surface**: Limits where resources can be loaded from.
- **Mitigates XSS Attacks**: Blocks execution of unauthorized scripts.
- **Reporting**: Allows monitoring of policy violations.

#### OWASP Security Risks

The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** provides resources for web application security, including the well-known **OWASP Top Ten** list of critical security risks.

**OWASP Top Ten (Latest Edition)**:

1. **Broken Access Control**: Unauthorized access to resources.

#### API Security

**API Security** focuses on safeguarding APIs from malicious attacks and misuse, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can access them.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the client (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).
- **Authorization**: Determining the client's permissions (e.g., access control lists).
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring data integrity by validating inputs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracking API usage and detecting anomalies.

**Best Practices**:

- **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt API traffic to protect data in transit.
- **Implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect**: For secure authentication and authorization.
- **Employ Throttling**: Limit request rates to prevent DDoS attacks.
- **Adopt API Gateways**: Centralize security enforcement and management.
- **Regular Testing**: Conduct security assessments and penetration tests.

**API Security Layers**:

```
[Client]
   |
[Authentication Layer] -- Validates identity
   |
[Authorization Layer] -- Checks permissions
   |
[API Logic]
```

#### Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** verifies who the user is, while **authorization** determines what they can access.

**Authentication Methods**:

- **Password-Based**: Traditional username and password.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines something you know (password) with something you have (token) or something you are (biometrics).
- **Token-Based**: Uses tokens like JWT for stateless authentication.
- **Biometric**: Fingerprints, facial recognition.

**Authorization Models**:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned roles.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access decisions based on attributes (user, resource, environment).
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Specific permissions for each user and resource.

**OAuth 2.0 Framework**:

- **Resource Owner**: The user.
- **Client**: The application requesting access.
- **Resource Server**: Hosts the protected resources.
- **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens after authenticating the user.

**OAuth 2.0 Flow Diagram**:

```
[Client] -- Authorization Request --> [Authorization Server]
                  |
    [User Authenticates and Authorizes]
                  |
[Client] <-- Access Token Issued -- [Authorization Server]
                  |
[Client] -- API Request with Token --> [Resource Server]
```

#### Data Encryption

**Data Encryption** transforms readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access.

**Encryption Types**:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key used for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA).

**Common Algorithms**:

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used symmetric encryption.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: Common asymmetric encryption.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Efficient asymmetric encryption.

**Hash Functions**:

- **Purpose**: Convert data into a fixed-size hash value.
- **Characteristics**: One-way functions; difficult to reverse.
- **Common Hash Algorithms**: SHA-256, SHA-3.

**Encryption Workflow**:

#### Generate a CSR on Your Server

Generating a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** is a crucial step in obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate for your server, enabling HTTPS.

**Steps to Generate a CSR with OpenSSL**:

1. **Generate a Private Key**:

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out your_domain.com.key 2048
   ```

   - **2048**: Specifies the key length (bits). A higher number means stronger encryption.

2. **Generate the CSR**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key your_domain.com.key -out your_domain.com.csr
   ```

3. **Enter Required Information**:

   - **Country Name (C)**: Two-letter country code (e.g., US).
   - **State or Province Name (ST)**: Full state or province name.
   - **Locality Name (L)**: City.
   - **Organization Name (O)**: Legal name of your organization.
   - **Organizational Unit Name (OU)**: Department (optional).
   - **Common Name (CN)**: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (e.g., `www.your_domain.com`).
   - **Email Address**: Contact email.

4. **Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA)**:

   - Use the generated `.csr` file when applying for a certificate from a CA like Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, or Comodo.

5. **Install the SSL/TLS Certificate**:

   - After the CA issues your certificate, install it on your server alongside the private key.

**Important Considerations**:

- **Private Key Security**: Keep your private key secure and never share it.
- **Certificate Validity**: Certificates have expiration dates; ensure timely renewal.
- **Chain of Trust**: Install intermediate certificates if provided by the CA.

**Automating SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt**:

- **Certbot**: A tool to automatically obtain and install free SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.
- **Command Example**:

  ```bash
  sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
  ```

- **Renewal**: Certificates are valid for 90 days; set up automated renewal.

### What happens when you enter a URL in the browser?

When you type a URL into your browser, a lot of things happen behind the scenes to fetch and show the webpage you're looking for. Here's a breakdown of that process:

I. **Entering the URL**

- When you type something like `https://example-website.com` into your browser, you're not directly contacting the website, but rather its unique IP address.
- The IP address identifies the server where the website's data is stored. To connect, the browser needs to know this IP.
- This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes inâ€”it translates the domain name (like example-website.com) into the corresponding IP address.

II. **DNS Resolution**

- The browser asks DNS servers to find the IP address for the website you entered.
- If your device or router has seen this website before, it may have the address stored (cached), but if not, the request moves up to larger DNS servers.
- Once the IP is found, itâ€™s sent back to your browser, sometimes being cached for quicker future visits.

III. **Setting Up a TCP Connection**

- Now, the browser and server need to establish a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures that data is reliably transferred between them.
- The data travels through various networks, routers, and internet service providers (ISPs) to reach its destination.
- To speed this up, many websites use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). CDNs keep copies of website data in different locations worldwide, so the content can be served from a nearby server, reducing delays.

IV. **Sending HTTP Requests**

- After the TCP connection is set, the browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to the server.
- This request includes important information like what page or resource is being asked for and additional data in the headers.
- These details help the server understand exactly what the browser needs to send back.

V. **Receiving HTTP Responses**

- The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
- This response includes the resources needed to display the webpageâ€”things like HTML files, CSS styles, JavaScript code, and images.

VI. **Rendering the Webpage**

- The browser processes the response and begins to build the webpage.
- It constructs two key structures: the Document Object Model (DOM) for the HTML and the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) for the styles. These are then combined to render the page you see.
- Different browsers may display the webpage slightly differently because each browser interprets and renders content based on its own design and supported technologies. While the main content remains the same, small variations might appear from one browser to another.
